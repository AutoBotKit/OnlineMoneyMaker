# Earn Money by Walking


### Can you make money by walking?
#### Surprisingly, yes â€“ in quite a lot of ways.

### If you're looking for an app that pays you to walk, here are the best ones
 - [SweatCoin](https://eliteurl.com/SweatCoin)
- [GenoPets](https://www.genopets.me/)
- [StepN](https://stepn.com/)

From only 1 app you will not get rich, especially if you are a lazy person and don't make more than 5000 steps per day, but if you use all apps listed here, in total you can get a substantial income per month.

Personally, I make up to $30 monthly per app(only from walking/steps, not counting referrer rewards)
So, my monthly income from using all apps:
- Only from steps $90 = $30 * 3

So, monthly I get $90+ by literally doing nothing(only from walking/steps).

 #### From Referral system I make much more, but I don't mention the total as its depend on total referer you have, a method how to get mane referer its described here => [Earn by Referral](https://github.com/AutoBotKit/OnlineMoneyMaker/blob/main/MultiAccount.md).

* ### IMPORTANT:
 - all apps are available only on iOS and Android, you can't make money with them from a Desktop PC/Laptop
 - usually, after you restarting your phone, apps will not start automatically, you have to set **autostart** in settings in order to exclude this thing.
